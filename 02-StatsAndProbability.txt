----What is Data?---
There is qualitative and quantitative data. 

Qualitative can be broken up
into nominal (unordered, like male and female) and ordinal (ordered,
like good, bad, average). 

Quantitative can be broken up into discrete
(finite number of measurement, like students in a class) and continuous
(infinite possibilities, like the weight of a person)


---Statistics----
Population: A collection of things whose properties are to be analyzed.
Sample: A subset of the population. A well chosen sample will contain
most of the information about a population parameter.

Sampling is used to draw inferences about the entire population; most times
it is unreasonable to go out and collect data on the entire population of data.

There is probablity sampling and non-probability sampling, but we are going to get into
the probablity sampling types.

Random sampling - each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
Systematic sampling - every nth record is chosen from the population. Like chosing
every other group.
Stratified sampling - choosing a subset of a population that shares one common
characteristic. This is like diving a population into male and female, and then
testing.

--Types of statistics--
Descriptive statistics: Uses the data to provide descriptions of the population,
analyzing a population and describing their characteristics.

These are the measures of central tendency(mean, median, mode) and 
measures of variability(variance, range, sd)

Variance is how much a random variable differs from its expected value.

Inferential statistics: makes predictions about a population based on a sample taken.
We apply probablity.



--Information Gain and Entropy--
Entropy measures the impurity or uncertainity measured in the data.
Information gain indicates how much 'information' a particular
feature/variable gives about a final outcome.

Let's see an example.
